 * struct regulator_ops - regulator operations.
 *
 * This struct describes regulator operations which can be implemented by

 *
 * @enable: Enable the regulator.
 * @disable: Disable the regulator.
 * @is_enabled: Return 1 if the regulator is enabled, 0 otherwise.
 *
 * @set_voltage: Set the voltage for the regulator within the range specified.
 *               The driver should select the voltage closest to min_uV.
 * @get_voltage: Return the currently configured voltage for the regulator.
 *
 * @set_current_limit: Configure a limit for a current-limited regulator.
 * @get_current_limit: Get the limit for a current-limited regulator.
 *
 * @set_mode: Set the operating mode for the regulator.
 * @get_mode: Get the current operating mode for the regulator.
 * @get_optimum_mode: Get the most efficient operating mode for the regulator
 *                    when running with the specified parameters.
 *
 * @set_suspend_voltage: Set the voltage for the regulator when the system
 *                       is suspended.
 * @set_suspend_enable: Mark the regulator as enabled when the system is
 *                      suspended.
 * @set_suspend_disable: Mark the regulator as disabled when the system is
 *                       suspended.
 * @set_suspend_mode: Set the operating mode for the regulator when the
 *                    system is suspended.
