 * unique device: a platform_device entry in fsl_plat_devs[] plus

 *
 * A chip is described by a set of unique devices.
 *
 * Each sub-arch has its own master list of unique devices and
 * enumerates them by enum fsl_devices in a sub-arch specific header
 *
 * The platform data structure is broken into two parts.  The
 * first is device specific information that help identify any
 * unique features of a peripheral.  The second is any
 * information that may be defined by the board or how the device
 * is connected externally of the chip.
 *
 * naming conventions:
 * - platform data structures: <driver>_platform_data
 * - platform data device flags: FSL_<driver>_DEV_<FLAG>
 * - platform data board flags: FSL_<driver>_BRD_<FLAG>
