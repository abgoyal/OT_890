/**
 * walk_page_range - walk a memory map's page tables with a callback
 * @mm: memory map to walk
 * @addr: starting address
 * @end: ending address
 * @walk: set of callbacks to invoke for each level of the tree
 *
 * Recursively walk the page table for the memory area in a VMA,
 * calling supplied callbacks. Callbacks are called in-order (first
 * PGD, first PUD, first PMD, first PTE, second PTE... second PMD,
 * etc.). If lower-level callbacks are omitted, walking depth is reduced.
 *
 * Each callback receives an entry pointer and the start and end of the
 * associated range, and a copy of the original mm_walk for access to
 * the ->private or ->mm fields.
 *
 * No locks are taken, but the bottom level iterator will map PTE
 * directories from highmem if necessary.
 *
 * If any callback returns a non-zero value, the walk is aborted and
 * the return value is propagated back to the caller. Otherwise 0 is returned.
