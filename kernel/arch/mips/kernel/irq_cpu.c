 * Almost all MIPS CPUs define 8 interrupt sources.  They are typically
 * level triggered (i.e., cannot be cleared from CPU; must be cleared from
 * device).  The first two are software interrupts which we don't really

 * counter register is present or, for CPUs with an external FPU, by
 * convention it's the FPU exception interrupt.
 *
