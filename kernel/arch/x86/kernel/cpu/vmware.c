 * VMware hypervisor takes care of exporting a reliable TSC to the guest.
 * Still, due to timing difference when running on virtual cpus, the TSC can
 * be marked as unstable in some cases. For example, the TSC sync check at
 * bootup can fail due to a marginal offset between vcpus' TSCs (though the
 * TSCs do not drift from each other).  Also, the ACPI PM timer clocksource
 * is not suitable as a watchdog when running on a hypervisor because the
 * kernel may miss a wrap of the counter if the vcpu is descheduled for a
 * long time. To skip these checks at runtime we set these capability bits,
 * so that the kernel could just trust the hypervisor with providing a
 * reliable virtual TSC that is suitable for timekeeping.
